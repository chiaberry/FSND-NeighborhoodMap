# FSND-NeighborhoodMap
Neighborhood Map project for Udacity FullStack

This project uses Google Maps, KnockoutJS, Bootstrap and JQuery to display some of the places I visit in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Mexico. 

Clicking on a location brings up a marker with information from Foursquare. 
In the upper right hand corner of the page is the current temperature from Weather Underground. Clicking the temperature toggles the units between Farenheit and Celsius.


## How to run

Copy all the files onto your local machine, click `index.html` to launch. You must be connected to the internet for the project to load.

Conversely, you can see the map at https://chiaberry.github.io
