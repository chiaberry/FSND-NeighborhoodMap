# FSND-NeighborhoodMap
Neighborhood Map project for Udacity FullStack

This project uses Google Maps and KnockoutJS to display some of the places I visit in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Mexico. 

Clicking on a location brings up a marker with information from Foursquare. 
In the upper right hand corner of the page is the current temperature from Weather Underground. Clicking the temperature toggles the units between Farenheit and Celsius.

You can see the map at https://chiaberry.github.io
